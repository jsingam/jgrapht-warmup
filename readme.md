This is a warmup exercise done for the jgrapght.
This finds the closest common anchester between two people.
The family tree has to be given as a dot file (sample dot file is in the src/main/resources directory)

The programs needs 3 arguments
	*dot file
	*name 1
	*name 2

The code can be inspected and can be run using IDEs.
But for the simplicity the jar file is also given.

Execute the command:
	java -jar jgraphtwarmup.jar <file> <name1> <name2>

an example is given below
	java -jar jgraphtwarmup.jar '/home/singam/Documents/gsoc/jgraph/jgraphtwarmup/src/main/resources/sample.dot' Jon Tommen
	
execute this command in the terminal to get start with the jar.

The code is commented and contains the test cases. So understanding and edithing the code is easy.
